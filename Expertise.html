    <h3>Objective of this Consultancy</h3>

    <p>
      DEVELOPMENT and SUSTAINABILITY should always go hand in hand. The three PILLARS of Sustainability viz., Social, Environmental
      and Financial Performances decide the BOTTOM LINE of an Industry. Over the years , the Society and Environment gained
      momentum and prominence and started having a say in the running of the Industry. The Industries are left with no other
      choice than stay focused on these two aspects also apart from Financial aspects, which was the only focus then. Due
      to Globalization Pressures and International Commitments , the Environmental Legislations are undergoing lots of changes
      and are becoming more stringent with every passing day. The Society for its part, puts many challenges on the Industry
      in its own way. The legal issues arising out of various Enviro-Social factors are to be tackled swiftly and promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, this Consultancy Services has been launched with a motive to help and assist the Industries to resolve the Environmental
      Challenges ,which will have a say on the bottom line. The Principal Environmental Consultant is an Engineer who won
      many coveted Awards from reputed Institutes and having 20+ years of rich hands on experience in the Environmental Field
      of Mining, Metal ,Cement & Power Sectors.
